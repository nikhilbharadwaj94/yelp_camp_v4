>>another imporatnat concept that i came across was "NESTED ROUTES".
 for example:-
 when we want to add new comments it dosent make sense to create a route /comments/new

 Instead it will make more sense to keep the comment associated with a particular post.
 So in this case we will create it as /campgrounds/:id/comments/new

 >>We are also creating 2 folders inside views i.e. campgrounds and comments
